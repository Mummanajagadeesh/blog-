Hi there! 👋 I'm **Jagadeesh Mummana**.  

I’m into robotics and AI, and honestly, I just love messing around with electronics and microcontrollers. There’s something super satisfying about making stuff work—especially when it comes to robots. I’m always up for teaming up with people who are as excited about this stuff as I am.

## A New Beginning 🚀

Welcome to my first-ever blog post! It’s 2025, and I figured it’s about time I started putting my thoughts and projects out there. So yeah, every **Friday**, I’ll be posting something new here—projects, ideas, random experiments, whatever feels right that week. Let’s see where this goes. 

My goal? Pretty simple: **share what I know and learn from whoever’s reading this**. I’ve always believed the best way to grow is by helping others grow too. So yeah, let’s learn together.

I’ve been learning so much over the past couple of years, but I realized I rarely document anything. Half the stuff I’ve built lives in random folders on my laptop or notebooks gathering dust. A blog felt like the perfect way to organize my thoughts, get feedback, and maybe help others who are on similar journeys. Plus, it’s a solid excuse to keep myself consistent—can’t slack off if there’s an audience, right?

> **Motto:** "Knowledge grows best when shared." 

## Who Am I?  
`$whoami`

I’m just a sophomore at **NIT Calicut** studying **Electronics and Communication Engineering**, with a minor in **Robotics and Automation**. I’ve always been the kind of person who likes to take things apart just to see how they work (and, sometimes, to break them). 

Whether it’s designing robots, coding up some AI models, or just fiddling with circuits, I love the overlap between software and hardware. 

Oh, and I’ll be honest: I’m also that guy who jumps from one project to another when boredom hits. But hey, it keeps things interesting, right? This blog is my way of documenting the chaos and maybe simplifying some of the stuff I’ve learned along the way.

And yeah, like every robotics enthusiast, I’ve had my fair share of sparks and fried circuits along the way. (RIP to my first Arduino board—I barely knew you.

## What Am I Up To? 🔍  

Here are a few things I’ve been working on:

1. **[PR057H371C4RM](https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/PR057H371C4RM)** – *Prosthetic Arm*  
   It’s a prosthetic arm that tries to mimic finger movements. Basically, it uses servos to pull strings (kind of like how tendons work in real life).

2. **[V-RU81K5CU83](https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/V-RU81K5CU83)** (*part of [RU83C](https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/RU83C)*) – *Virtual Rubik's Cube Simulator*  
   A 3D Rubik’s Cube simulator I built in Unity. It uses the Kociemba Solver to spit out solutions for whatever cube state you throw at it.

3. **[ImProVe](https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/ImProVe)** – *Image Processing Using Verilog*  
   This one’s about using Verilog for basic image processing—stuff like edge detection and geometric transformations. It’s been a fun mix of hardware and software. Here are a couple of spin-offs from this project:

![ImProVe - Label Detection](hw/improve-label.png)


   - **Label Detection**:  
     Using Prewitt and Canny edge detectors to find label boundaries. The idea is to detect sudden intensity changes and slap a bounding box over them. Python helps put it all together in the end.  

   - **Document Scanner** (*In Progress*):  
     Building off the label detection thing, this one’s about finding the four corners of a document and mapping it to a rectangle. Eventually, I want to throw OCR into the mix to extract text too.

     

> **Heads-up:** Due to some constraints, some repositories are currently private. If you’re curious about any of them, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to share what I can! 

🌟 I’ll dive deeper into these projects in future posts, so if any of this sounds cool, stick around. Tutorials, breakdowns, lessons learned—all of that’s coming. 

Got ideas or stuff you want me to write about? Drop a comment or hit me up on **[LinkedIn](#connect-with-me-)**.

## Let’s Collaborate 🤝  

If any of these projects sound interesting or if you’ve got something in mind you’d like to team up on, let me know. I’m always open to new ideas and collaborations. And if you’re stuck on something and need help, just ask—I’ll do what I can.
